Hi! I'm a second-year PhD student in mathematics at the University of
Pennsylvania, where I study homotopy theory and related areas. I am also
interested in how we can make math more accessible and more friendly, both
narrowly in our communication and teaching, and broadly in how we engage with
mathematical communities and mathematical culture.

I co-organize the [graduate pizza
seminar](https://pizza-seminar.github.io){:target="_blank"} and run lots of
departmental social activities at Penn. During summers, I teach at [Canada/USA
Mathcamp](https://mathcamp.org){:target="_blank"}.

Before Penn, I was a mathematics-computer science major at Reed College. I wrote
my [undergraduate thesis](assets/undergrad-thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"} with
[Ang√©lica Osorno](https://people.reed.edu/~aosorno/){:target="_blank"} and [Adam
Groce](https://people.reed.edu/~agroce/){:target="_blank"} on categorical models
of cryptography. I was featured on [What Is a
Reedie](https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2024/what-is-a-reedie/riley-shahar.html){:target="_blank"},
where I talked about my thesis and my broader experience at Reed. I was an
organizer of both the math and CS student groups, and I co-organized the CS peer
mentorship program and the math student colloquium.

I am honored to be supported by the National Science Foundation's Graduate
Research Fellowship and by the University of Pennsylvania's Benjamin Franklin
Fellowship.
