  abstract: >
    Transfer systems are relatively simple combinatorial objects with deep
    connections to the theory of $$N_\infty$$ operads, an equivariant analogue of
    $$E_\infty$$ operads. In this talk, we informally present this homotopy-theoretic
    story so as to motivate the combinatorial study of saturated transfer
    systems, which in good cases classify linear isometries operads. We then
    give a novel method for enumerating saturated transfer systems on
    cylindrical modular lattices, for instance the subgroup lattices of finite
    cyclic groups, and tightly characterize the asymptotic behavior in the
    height of the cylinder. This talk presents joint work with several Reed
    College students along with Ang√©lica Osorno and Kyle Ormsby.
