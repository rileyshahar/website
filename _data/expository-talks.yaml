- title: The sequence 1, 11, 21, 1211, ... (its name is a spoiler!)
  date: 2025-09-05
  venue: Penn Pizza Seminar
  venue_url: https://pizza-seminar.github.io
  abstract: >
    This talk is about a very playful sequence, originally studied by John
    Conway, whose first terms are displayed in the title. We'll define the
    sequence, prove some of its basic properties, and then discuss Conway's
    "cosmological theorem," which determines the limiting behavior of the
    sequence. A surprising role is played by a particular endomorphism of the
    free monoid on 92 generators.

- title: A connectivity toolbox
  date: 2025-04-04
  venue: AMTRaK IV
  venue_url: https://web.sas.upenn.edu/callem/amtrak/
  abstract: >
    This talk will elaborate on the connectivity arguments that were swept under
    the rug during pre-talk 1. In particular, we will focus on tools and
    techniques coming from discrete Morse theory. After introducing the basics
    of discrete Morse theory, we will use it to prove the Solomon-Tits Theorem.

- title: The logical interpretation of topology
  date: 2025-02-07
  venue: Penn Graduate Geometry-Topology Seminar
  abstract: >
    Our standard intuition for abstract topology is geometric: the notion of
    open set axiomatized the properties of open balls in metric spaces. Maybe
    surprisingly, there is an equally applicable, and in some sense formally
    dual, logical interpretation of topological spaces. In this interpretation,
    open sets behave like "propositions subject to finite proof." This
    talk---which assumes no knowledge of mathematical logic---will explore this
    perspective, in particular as it relates to point-free topology and
    sheaves.

- title: Artin gluing in logic
  date: 2025-02-10
  venue: Penn Graduate Logic Seminar
  abstract: >
    A standard approach to proving meta-theoretic properties of a proof system
    or type theory is to first define a stronger dependent predicate R---often
    called a logical relation---by induction on syntax, and prove the desired
    property by showing that every well-formed term satisfies this stronger
    property. In categorical semantics, this technique looks like an Artin
    gluing of the syntactic category along a hom-functor. This talk will
    introduce this technique, at least in the special case of so-called
    "sconing," and utilize it for a categorical proof of the existence property
    of intuitionistic logic.

- title: Girard's paradox for set theorists, via Hurkens
  date: 2024-11-22}
  venue: Penn Graduate Logic Seminar
  abstract: >
    Girard's paradox is an analogue of Russell's paradox which demonstrates the
    inconsistency of a sufficiently rich type theory with a "type of all types."
    In this talk, I will present a simplified version of the paradox due to
    Hurkens (1995), which in particular has a nice analogue in naive set theory.
    After treating this classical intuition and the type-theoretic argument, if
    we have time we will implement the paradox in Lean.

- title: Towards linear topoi
  date: 2024-09-27
  venue: Penn Graduate Logic Seminar
  abstract: >
    Topos theory plays a central role in geometry and categorical logic. For
    instance, topoi yield a natural semantic theory of intuitionistic dependent
    type theories. One important step in this theory is the observation that
    topoi are Heyting categories, i.e. that propositions in the internal logic
    of a topos can be refined along intuitionistic predicates. In this talk, I
    will attempt to give an accessible outline of this classical story and
    motivate the study of "linear topoi", categories which exhibit topos-like
    behavior with respect to a linear internal logic. I will conclude with a
    discussion of some progress towards an axiomatic presentation of these
    categories.

- title: Classifying spaces of categories
  date: 2025-03-18
  venue: Penn Kan Seminar on Algebraic K-Theory
  venue_url: https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~mmerling/math619_25.html
  abstract: >
    We motivate and define the classifying space of a category and discuss
    Quillen's Theorems A and B, which give powerful tools for computing
    homotopical information about a functor.

- title: Deloopings of categories
  date: 2025-04-15
  venue: Penn Kan Seminar on Algebraic K-Theory
  venue_url: https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~mmerling/math619_25.html
  abstract: >
    We give a high-level intuition for why spaces with highly-coherent
    homotopy-commutative and associative multiplications should model infinite
    loop spaces. We discuss two machines for identifying such space spaces\: May's
    operads and Segal's gamma spaces. We conclude with a discussion of
    categories of operators and the May-Thomason uniqueness theorem for infinite
    loop space machines.

- title: The K-theory of Lawvere theories
  date: 2025-04-24
  venue: Penn Kan Seminar on Algebraic K-Theory
  venue_url: https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~mmerling/math619_25.html
  abstract: >
    We introduce Lawvere theories and then discuss Bohmann-Szymik's work on
    their K-theory. From the K-theoretic perspective, Lawvere theories are a
    convenient generalization of rings in which Quillen's +=Q theorem still
    holds, enabling a more computationally tractable K-theory than more general
    settings.

- title: Categorical semantics, via vibes
  date: 2025-01-24
  venue: Penn Pizza Seminar

  abstract: >
    You might have heard of "categorical semantics" or "internal logics," or of
    the relationship between topoi and intuitionistic logic, perhaps in Jin and
    Carmine's pizza seminar talks from last semester. You also might not have!
    Regardless, this talk aims to explain the big picture of what these terms
    mean, how they relate, and why non-logicians might care.
