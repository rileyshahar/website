  description: >
    An informal introduction to the fundamental group, without relying on any
    underlying point-set topology.

  files: category-theory-from-scratch
  description: >
    An inquiry-based introduction to category theory. At the start of the class,
    students made a list of various families of mathematical constructions they
    thought could be generalized---like the cartesian product of sets and the
    direct product of groups---then searched for categorical properties
    encapsulating these families.

  week: 3
  files: oops-all-algebra
  description: >
    An introduction to the theory of infinity-categories in the model of
    quasicategories. We discussed the need for such a theory, the difficulties
    with handling coherence, defined simplicial sets, studied the nerve of a
    category to motivate the definition of a quasicategory, and sketched the
    proof that infinity-groupoids are Kan complexes.

- title: A Tour of Paradox

  year: 2025
  week: 4
  description: >
    A survey of various paradoxes from philosophical and mathematical history.
    Each day started with a ~10 minute lecture discussing the paradox, and then
    students discussed the paradox and talked about how various mathematial
    ideas might help us think about it differently. Paradoxes discussed included
    Zeno's paradoxes of motion, the Sorites paradox and other paradoxes of
    ambiguity, paradoxes of the material conditional, and paradoxes of
    self-reference like the liar's and Russell's paradoxes.

    An introduction to the combinatorics of saturated transfer systems and
    submonoids.
