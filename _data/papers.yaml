  abstract: >
    Given a finite commutative monoid $$M$$, we show that submonoids of
    $$M\times [n]$$ --- where $$[n] = \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$$ is equipped with the
    max operation $$\vee$$ --- may be enumerated via the transfer matrix method.
    When $$M$$ is also idempotent, we show that there are finitely many integers
    $$\lambda$$ and rational numbers $$b_\lambda$$ (only depending on $$M$$)
    such that the number of submonoids of $$M\times [n]$$ is $$\sum_\lambda
    b_\lambda\lambda^n$$. This answers a question of Knuth regarding ternary
    (and higher order) max-closed relations, and has applications to the
    enumeration of saturated transfer systems in equivariant infinite loop space
    theory.
